                        <p>
                            A few years after the Taylor estate started doing well, he was joined by Thomas Lipton, the founder of 
                            Lipton Tea. For many years to come, Lipton remained the most famous brand in the UK. Nowadays, it’s not 
                            as highly ranked as it used to be, but it sure made its mark. Lipton was the first to add brewing instructions 
                            on tea bags and lower the cost of tea so that it was attainable by everyone. In Sri Lanka, the tea brand Lipton 
                            Ceylonta is one of the favorites when making pots of sweet, strong tea to have with short eats.

                        <p>
                            The story of Vintage Teas begins with three men and a cricket ball.Being pioneers in the tea industry, the three founders 
                            of Vintage Teas, Sriantha Rajapakse, Mahinda Karunanayake and Vinodh Wijetunga felt it was time to venture out on their own. 
                            As with all success stories, it wasn’t that simple, their venture was viewed with scepticism until finally fate gave them an 
                            appointment with an ardent cricket enthusiast at the last bank on their list.The gentleman immediately recognised Sriantha 
                            Rajapakse from his earlier days as a national cricketer and the rest as they say, is history.That was yesterday. And this is 
                            what we do today.With a new office and a factory complex that covers more than two acres of land, 100 employees, and clients
                            around the globe, Vintage Teas has grown to become one of Sri Lanka’s largest tea exporters.Our teas encompass the finest tastes 
                            and textures, using state-of-the-art equipment to create full-bodied aromatic blends, but our work doesn’t end there. Each product 
                            is individually packaged to retain its freshness and thereafter shipped to specific clients. Vintage Teas makes sure each order is 
                            tracked along its route and delivered on time, everytime.
