      <h1>SRI LANKA'S TEA INDUSTRY</h1>
      <p>
        Sri Lankan tea known for generations as “Ceylon Tea” is reputed for its’
        taste and aroma world over. Sri Lanka is the largest producer of
        orthodox tea in the world. Currently, Sri Lanka ranks as the fourth
        largest tea producer of the world. In the global export front, the
        country holds the position of third largest exporter of tea. Sri Lanka
        applies ISO 3720 as the minimum standards for tea. Sri Lankan tea
        growers and manufactures adopt Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) and
        Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and produce tea under the highest
        social and environmental standards.

    <!--Aout ceylon tea history-->

    <section class="section1">
      <h1>CEYLON TEA HISTORY</h1>
      <p>
        It was as far back as the year 1824 in which the British brought a tea plant from China to 
        Ceylon (as Sri Lanka was known at the time). It was planted in the Royal Botanical Gardens, 
        Peradeniya and is considered to have been the first non-commercial tea plant in Sri Lanka.<br><br>

        After nearly two decades in 1867, James Taylor, Scottish by origin, planted 19 acres of tea 
        in the city of Kandy in Ceylon, at the Loolecondra Estate as the first commercial tea plantation. 
        The eventual sale of Loolecondra teas resulted in 1872, in Kandy and the first tea consignment to 
        London in 1873. These pioneering efforts were done by trial and error and improved over the years via 
        the introduction and improvement of tea processing machines and methods, by different individuals and companies.<br><br>

        The first broking firm John Brothers & Co. was established in 1876 and the first public Colombo auction took place 
        in 1883 under the guidance of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (which was established in 1839). The Colombo Tea Traders' 
        Association was formed in 1894 and in 1925 the Tea Research Institute was established. These organizations helped boost 
        the production and export of Ceylon Teas in its early stages.

    <!------This section is about the importance of origin------>

    <section class="section2">
      <h1>The Importance of Origin</h1>
      <p>
        There are three main tea growing regions in Sri Lanka. These are, Low
        grown teas which are teas grown on an elevation between sea level to
        600m, Mid Grown teas which are from 600m to 1,200m and High grown teas
        which are grown at an elevation above 1,200m. The taste, flavour and
        aroma of teas from each elevation are influenced by the conditions
        particular to those regions. Low grown teas, which are subjected to long
        periods of sunshine, dry and somewhat warm and moist conditions, exhibit
        a burgundy brown liquor and a malt, heavy note with black leaf
        appearance. Whereas High grown teas grown on an elevation of around
        3,000 feet would be dramatically different-depending on the time of
        year, influenced by the chill winds, dry and cool conditions these teas
        are likely to be extraordinarily light, with greenish, grassy tones in
        honey golden liquors.
      </p><br>

      <p>
        The tea-growing regions of Sri Lanka are clustered mostly among the
        central mountains of the island and its southern foot hills. Like the
        great wine-growing regions of France, the tea cultivation of Sri Lanka
        is divided up into seven defined regions or ‘districts’, each of which
        is known for producing teas of a particular character. Each presents a
        unique combination of climate and terrain that leaves its mark on the
        tea it produces, regardless of price point or estate of origin. Of
        course, there is considerable variation between sub-districts and
        individual estates, between successive crops taken from the same estate
        in successive years and even between different hillsides on the same
        estate; yet despite such differences, the regional character of the tea
        is always evident to the experienced taster or connoisseur.

      <h3>Tea growing places in Sri Lanka</h3>
      <p>
        In addition, Sri Lanka’s tea-growing areas are also divided into seven
        main regions based mainly on the terroir, namely
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Nuwara Eliya</li>
        <li>Uda Pussellawa</li>
        <li>Uva</li>
        <li>Dimbula</li>
        <li>Kandy</li>
        <li>Sabaragamuwa</li>
        <li>Ruhuna</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each area produces a uniquely flavoured Ceylon Tea, mainly due to the
        contrasting elevation, climate, and terrain in each region.

        In over one hundred and fifty years, the name Ceylon had become
        synonymous with the world's finest tea.<br />
        In the world's eye and tongue, Ceylon was tea and tea was Ceylon.
