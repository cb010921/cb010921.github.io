                <h3>The History of Ceylon Tea Museum</h3>

                <p>
                    The Ceylon Tea Museum is located in the former Hanthana Tea Factory,which was originally 
                    constructed in 1925. It is situated 3 km (1.9 mi) south of Kandy. The Ceylon Tea Museum was 
                    incorporated on 9 January 1998, under Section 21 of the Companies Act of 1982, in a move initiated 
                    by Clifford Ratwatte (Chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board). The museum was formally opened on 1 
                    December 2001.

                <h3>Description of the Museum</h3>

                <p>
                    The Ceylon Tea Museum at Hantane, three kilometres from Kandy city is served by a motorable 
                    road that circles the museum, provides easy access and adequate parking facilities for cars 
                    and tourist coaches. The museum consists of four floors. The ground floor and the second floor 
                    exhibit very old items of machinery and the first floor consist of a library and an auditorium 
                    with facilities for audio visual presentations. The third floor is allocated to tea sales outlets, 
                    where a selection of Sri Lanka's fine tea is available. The entire top floor is a tea cafe. 
                    A panoramic view of the Kandy town surrounded by the beautiful Hunasgiriya, Knuckles Range 
                    and the Matale range of hills can be viewed through a telescope mounted on the fourth floor. 
                    The grounds surrounding the Tea Museum are landscaped with different varieties of teas. Kandy 
                    is a mandatory stop virtually on every tourist's itinerary and the location of the Ceylon Tea 
                    Museum at Hantane enhances the attraction of the hill country to visitors. Additionally, its 
                    proximity to the Peradeniya Botanical Gardens and Loolecondera estate, where tea was first grown 
                    commercially in Sri Lanka makes Hantane the perfect location.<br><br>
